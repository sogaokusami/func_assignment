Early stages of my full stack journey. This is an assignment we were given in class

1. The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Write a function named tellFortune 
takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be an X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

Where X is the job title , Y is the location , Z is the partners name, and N is the number of children

Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.


2. The Puppy Age Calculator

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
takes 1 parameter: puppy's age.
calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.


3. The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favourite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for the rest of the life .
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.


4. The Geometrizer

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius and output. "The circumference is NN."
Also, create a function called calcArea:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the area based on the radius and output. "The area is NN."

5. The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".


Create another function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."

***you can Google formular to calculate fahrenheit to celsius and vice versa
